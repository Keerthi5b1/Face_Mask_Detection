# Real_Time_Face_Mask_Detection
Real time face mask detection using CNN and OpenCV

## About Project
In this global pandemic of COVID-19, there is a critical need for self-protective devices, the most important of them is a face mask.
Our projectâ€™s main aim is for identifying the presence of a face mask on person's face. A strategy should be formulated to make the people accept this essential
safety measure. To check this, a face mask detector system should be used. To check the presence of a facemask on a human face, the primary step is the detection of
human face. This can be divided into two parts: verifying faces on theimages and detection of masks on their faces.
Face masks are used to prevent cross-contamination as part of an infection control strategy.
